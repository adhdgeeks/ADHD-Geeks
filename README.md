# Are you a geek?

* Do you like technology?
** What about computing?
** And electronics and electricity?
** What about mechanics?
* Do you have an insatiable curiosity?
** Does that overwhelms you and directs you to too many topics?
** Do you have difficulties or even unable to concentrate and finish one of them?
# Are you ADHD and a geek?

FORMAL + FUNNY DESCRIPTION ABOUT ADHD

Some joke about ADHD and geeks.

# (put very important formatting) VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:

If you are a geek and suspect to have ADHD:
* Please do [this survey]() and consult the best possible specialist you can find/afford.
** Some places lack of good ones, even some governments and institutions still do not recognize ADHD. Some people have issues coping with ADHD symptoms and need prescription drugs for them, but the best treatment is too expensive (we still can't do something about this other than be activists) and/nor are extremely picky about giving it (specially to adults).

* Please be aware of credentials of professionals in your case. If you can't pay a private specialist, consult the available resources in your country

* Organizations:
** We are neutral: We provide personal opinions here, despite they may be controversial (Aren't people with ADHD . Please don't use this for propaganda or attacks against us because different opinions. You can make an organization in your country (collect iteratively information about how to make an NGO on different countries, default papers to fill and how to submit them


## Do you know some geek that has diagnosed ADHD or suspect he might have it?

* You can ask him to look at this place.
** Please be respectful and tactful about it, it's something that might worry us a lot or be in denial phase.
*** We aren't a professional to diagnose it formally and your perceptions might be biased.
*** Please don't get into hairy zone until you are sure and that person trusts you. You can also ask us for information and advice, but _there aren't mental healthcare professionals collaborating with us at this moment_ (looking into this).



# _IMPORTANT NOTICE_

This is an ongoing geek-friendly collaborative OPEN and free (both as in freedom and as in beer) support group:

* We have ADHD, but not ashamed of it:
** The members here aren't afraid of showing others you have this different brain:
Despite some people might be unable to understanding ADHD or react negatively about it, some people can be toxic despite how you are too.
*** This applies to both friendship and if you're into a sentimental relationship or wanting to have one.
** We feel the need to be proud of ourselves and improve our lifes: We want to support us collaborative just as in Open Source (common interests).

* No censoring!:
** The way is just moderating against basic conduct rules, respect to laws and not attacking people: No unnecessarily complex bureaucratic rules or unreadable Codes of Conduct, some of us aren't so comfortable with boring stuff and many of us consider legalese to be boring. We don't tolerate trolling, you are advised.* We are used to certain tools and ways.
** The idea is to use technical tools in a way to help us to organize better and indirectly use it in a therapeutic process.
** At same time, make them to be used in a productive way: Make us use them in a way to change bad habits to good ones:
*** Lack of focus: The use of tools to follow schedules and make you remember it until you do it, gaining self-discipline and avoid cheating or ignoring alarms. Lots of us have this issue.
*** Procrastinating: Our minds are extremely creative and full of ideas, we feel the impulse to satiate our immediate needs and often forget the important tasks to be done. Our quest is to control this powerful inner child to the way of making our responsibilities first, then "play" but in a productive way and make the learning process as funny as possible.

--> In fact, this project did born after tons of procrastinating and lack of focus on other tasks.

# How this started
##About the originator of the idea

* His name is Jose, nickname Timofonic.
* He borns and lives in Malaga (Spain).
* He got diagnosed ADHD with severe concentration and mild depressive symptoms by adulthood at 29 years old.
** He was informally diagnosed in childhood with some undetermined prescription treatment.
** He got a private diagnostic, despite his bad familiar economy. He finally got one from public healthcare too.
** He's unable to pay for therapies because it's too expensive: Public healthcare doesn't care about therapies, just prescription drugs and following the patient.
** He was unable to find proper specialists for Adult ADHD: In fact, he tried an expensive month of therapy in a  psychologist and pedagogist consult for children with mixed results.
** Is currently awaiting to get valued to have a disability degree (link).
* He was previously very ashamed of explaining others he has ADHD: This public showing is a way of overcome that and experiment with an alternate idea that might be beneficial for him too.
** This got very toxic for him and caused too much anxiety.
**  He started to feel better and more motivated after an isolating and anxiety/depressive stage: Severe sleep issues, excessive smoking, eating disorders, anxiety, depressive symptoms and apathy.


## A community for Geek minded adolescent/adult people with ADHD
* Communities: It seems they are mostly a place to complain about their conditions, but not provided (pro)active support:
** Excessive promotion about products and services: Disabilities like ADHD and Asperger are just a way to make business these days, there's a lack of real sensibility towards the individual.
** Not real solidarity: There's a lack of a solidarity support chain between ADHD people. This needs to be changed.
* Adults with ADHD and support: Adults with ADHD are often forgotten because our condition doesn't imply an intellectual disability and supposedly our experience can help us to cope with our symptoms and overcome them. This isn't always the case, there's lots of conditions and factors that might make it very had to realize.
** This causes us a big sentiment of guilt and anxiety/depression very few people that don't suffered it are able to understand: This is specially traumatic if you had issues with studies/work/relationships since childhood and your parents weren't properly advised about it, so you develop a series of traumas and comorbid conditions that need to overcome later to have a proper life.
## Personal experience that made the original author to write this mess of words!

* The spark started some time ago at an accidental look at  #adhd chatroom at FreeNode, then writing with some geeky people with ADHD in the channel.
** The initial idea was to stay there and make an informal blog/wiki for it.
** The chatroom is taken into consideration: This started very spontaneously (it's my way!) and still not talked with the chatroom owners.
* The idea didn't even get started until very recently:
**After a series of chained personal crisis and another idea idea to the big list of other undone ones.
** As lots of other tasks, this was forgotten and other things got priority but got undone too.


## Why using GitHub instead a traditional forum and Wiki?

* GitHub is currently used by lots of potential geek people and can make ADHD geek people to locate our community better.
** Git epositories can be a better tool than a wiki in our mindset, forking might provide alternative sources too and avoid the Wikipedia case.
** A geek is potentially to be exposed to a tool such as Git: Despite the field of interest of the subject might be into other stuff, the interest in technology of a geek makes it to look at computers very closely.
* It's possible to have a site in GitHub: There's no need to have a complex site and this requires lots of time consuming tasks. Geek people with ADHD doesn't need another task to get distracted.
** We needs to find pragmatic solutions to our issues and don't feel alone in our quest to overcome our sympthoms and make the good part of ADHD to shine: We have lots of creativity, we are emotional and espontaneus, we are able to hyperfocus if we are really motivated and feel comfortable with doing something.

## Were your ADHD & related (anxiety, OCD, depression, etc) symptoms diagnosed in childhood or adulthood?
TO BE WRITTEN
#Initial ideas

##Structure
* One personal repository to share content about each user?
** I need to think about this: If users grow, this can have lots of projects and become messy to find people.What about one directory and use of forks and Pull Requests? Suggestions are welcome.

* Projects:
** They can be ADHD related or technology related: How to study for an exam, learn something, organize studies, organize some personal goal, a wishlist of things to do or make etc.
** People can make comments, fork or submit pull requests to improve them: This can be done by anyone, the content is going to be copyleft in GPL or CC-Share-Attribution (to be determined).

* Plans: They are a lot more like very fuzzy "projects".
** We are planning to do something, but not having clearly how to do it and how not get driven by distraction again.
** As always, constructive comments from other people are encouraged: Please keep in mind this is going to be public.
* Notes

** Some text you think is interesting to read, some curiosity in the geek or ADHD topics.
(To be discussed)

...
## Content ideas
- General and geek specific information about ADHD:
* Symptoms, diagnosis, advices and warnings.
** Interacting with mental healthcare professionals: How do they should behave, how can they behave. What to do if you feel ignored. Tricks of bad ones and how to overcome them, specially if you cannot choose other or the alternatives aren't potentially better.
** A list of good ones? It  could be controversial and accused of astroturfing or prone of it. We must be very picky and careful about it.
and become officially recognized by your government institutions to make them aware we exist, because being hidden as usual does us a lot more bad than good.

* How to use technology wisely to improve our productivity and avoid distraction:
** Not sure about others, but I'm an absolute information junkie and prefer to use the most concentrated source of information possible: I often forget things, so the digital world makes possible to backup everything and even avoid lost physical things too thanks to technology.
** Organize, optimize and sync information efficiently: How to properly use tools to manage information between diverse devices and sync in the automated possible way and avoid obsessive behaviors to happen and lose focus on the really important ones.
* Resources: Books, articles, organizations, psychology concepts, self-stem, sleep improving, relax techniques ways to improve psycho-motor skills even therapeutic ones (preferably copyleft)
